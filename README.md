# The Sims 4 Mods Manager
Program that downloads multiple mods from [thesimsresource.com](https://thesimsresource.com/) (TSR) and manages them.

### Why not use TSR's Custom Content Manager instead?
TSR's Custom Content Manager is only available to VIP members via a paid subscription and you can only download one item at a time.
With the The Sims 4 Mods Manager you can download multiple items and see the image in a separate, resizeable window instead of a tile.
